# BreastSubtypeR 1.5.1

## Bug fixes

- Fixed TNBC cohort detection in cohort-specific method selection (#133). Cohorts are now classified as TNBC only when all evaluable non-missing `TN` annotations indicate TN. Mixed cohorts containing both TN and nonTN samples are no longer routed to the TNBC-specific branch solely because some samples are TN.

## Tests

- Added synthetic phenotype-table tests for TN-only, mixed, UNC-like mixed, and missing or partly missing TN annotations.

# BreastSubtypeR 1.5.0

## Highlights (from v1.1.3 onward)

- Paper published in *NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics* (2025), **Editor's Choice** (DOI: 10.1093/nargab/lqaf131).
- Support for raw RNA-seq counts (requires gene lengths).
- **iBreastSubtypeR** refresh: cleaner UX, smarter AUTO guidance, consistent exports.

### Enhancements

- **ssBC/ssBC.v2: singleton subgroup robustness:** Subgroups with `n=1` no longer error:
  - Keeps matrix shape (`drop=FALSE`) and hardens dimnames/types.
  - Primary path: original `sspPredict()`.
    Fallback: nearest-centroid (Spearman) when needed.
  - If there are **0 common PAM50 genes**, returns `NA` labels with shaped `distances`/`dist.RORSubtype` to avoid downstream errors.
  - ROR computation guarded for incomplete inputs.
- **SSPBC output now "full":** `BS_sspbc()` and Shiny "sspbc" runs return a full metrics table (not calls-only).
  - Exports map core label columns to the standard names (`Call_5class` / `Call_4class` when applicable).
- **Shiny: "Load example data..." button**
  - One-click load of a small demo dataset from `inst/RshinyTest/` to explore the UI without uploads.
  - Shows a notification on success; users can immediately run **Preprocess & map** and analyses.
- **AUTO preflight UI (Shiny):** Now detects cohort kind (`TN`, `ER/HER2`, `ER`-only, `HER2`-only) and shows compact stats:
  - ER/HER2 subgroups: **ER+/HER2-**, **ER-/HER2-**, **ER+/HER2+**, **ER-/HER2+**
  - TN cohorts: **TN** vs **nonTN**
  - Readiness uses the same minimums used by AUTO (sourced programmatically; no duplicated thresholds).
- **Shorter notifications.**
  - Routine toasts (e.g., "Step 1 complete. Proceed to Step 2.") now auto-dismiss sooner to reduce UI clutter.
- **Phenodata normalization (Mapping):** Accepts flexible ER/HER2/TN encodings and normalizes to canonical forms (`ER+/ER-`, `HER2+/HER2-`, `TN/nonTN`). Ambiguous `HER2="2+"` remains as-is and raises a warning.

### Bug fixes

- **TN cohorts + ssBC**: `BS_Multi()` now respects TN cohorts when methods are specified manually; `ssBC`/`ssBC.v2` switch to `s = "TN"` / `"TN.v2"` when a `TN` column indicates a TN cohort. Falls back to `s = "ER"` / `"ER.v2"` otherwise.
- **AUTO**: Fixed a crash in `BS_Multi(methods = "AUTO")` when ER and/or HER2 contained missing values (NA).
- **AUTO internals**: fixed variable name typo (`samples_ERHER2.icd`).
- **Mapping():** Robust ENTREZID coercion (from `as.character()` to `as.integer()` with suppressed warnings).
- **cIHC.itr**: `outList$distances` now returned as numeric matrix.

### Shiny

- **Surface method warnings as toasts:**
  - Runs are wrapped in a warning handler; package warnings (e.g., ssBC.v2 singleton fallbacks) appear as yellow notifications.
  - Warnings include subgroup, `n`, and example sample IDs for quick triage.
- **Shiny preflight reset**:
  - Fixed a stale cohort summary after switching data sources (manual uploads <-> example). The preflight panel now revalidates once inputs change.

### Developer notes

- Added lightweight internal logger `._msg()` and replaced scattered `message()` calls in AUTO to standardize package output without affecting CRAN/Bioc checks.

### Documentation

- **README/vignette:** brief note on the example-data button and expected file locations.
- **Mapping(): Column metadata clarified.** Added explicit requirements for receptor fields used by AUTO and ER/HER2/TN-dependent methods (`ssBC`, `cIHC`/`cIHC.itr`, `PCAPAM50`) and for ROR covariates (`TSIZE`, `NODE` as numeric 0/1). Documented preferred coding and automatic normalization behavior.

### Compatibility Notes

- SSPBC "full" output keeps previous columns for calls; additional metrics may appear.

## Upgrade Notes

- Raw RNA-seq counts are supported **from v1.1.3 onward** (requires gene lengths).
- If you previously parsed `BS` / `BS.Subtype`, switch to **`Call_5class` / `Call_4class`**.
- Package API unchanged.
